National Interest Waiver Petition Letter
\end{center}

Dear Immigration Officer:\\
\strut \\
This petition is respectfully submitted in support of Mr. \myname's application for classification as a qualified immigrant under the preference of advanced degree professional/alien of exceptional ability. The evidence submitted herewith will specifically demonstrate that Mr. \myname qualifies for a National Interest Waiver under the standards set by Matter of Dhanasar, 26 I\&N Dec. 884 (AAO 2016).\\
\strut \\
Specifically, the evidence submitted will prove that:\\
1. Mr. \myname is a member of the professions holding an advanced degree;\\
2. Mr. \myname's proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance;\\
3. Mr. \myname is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor; and\\
4. On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the
requirements.

\emph{Note that the standard of proof for petitions filed for National
Interest Waiver cases is the ``preponderance of the evidence'' standard.
See Matter of Dhanasar, 26 I\&N Dec. 884, 889 (AAO 2016). Thus, if the
petitioner submits relevant, probative, and credible evidence that leads
USCIS to believe that the claim is ``more likely than not'' or
``probably true,'' the petitioner has satisfied the standard of proof.
Matter of E-M-, 20 I\&N Dec. 77, 79-80 (Comm'r 1989); see also U.S. v.
Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421 (1987) (discussing ``more likely than
not'' as a greater than 50\% chance of an occurrence taking place).}

Dhanasar indicates that the second prong of the analysis must consider whether the petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor (Dhanasar, at 890). This multifactorial assessment includes an evaluation of the petitioner's education, skills, knowledge, and record of success in related efforts; a model or plan for future activities; any progress made toward achieving the proposed endeavor; and the interest of potential customers, users, investors, or other relevant entities or individuals (Id.). Importantly, Dhanasar points out the inherent difficulty in "forecasting feasibility or future success", even in the presence of a cogent plan and competent execution;
therefore, petitioners are not required to show that their proposed endeavor is more likely than not to succeed (Id.). \exhibittext{Dhanasar}{22}{the Matter of DHANASAR, Petitioner, 26 I\&N Dec. 884 (AAO 2016)}

\section{\texorpdfstring{6. CONCLUSION}{6. CONCLUSION}}\label{conclusion}

As the documentary evidence and corroborating testimony from experts in the field establish, Mr.\myname is \emph{\textbf{\ul{a member of the professions holding an advanced degree}}}. He proposes to continue his research on \textbf{SOMETHING}, both of which are included in the \emph{\textbf{\ul{2024 Update of the White House Released Critical and Emerging Technologies List}}}. His endeavor is clearly with \emph{\textbf{\ul{substantial merit}}} and \emph{\textbf{\ul{national importance}}}. Mr. \myname's education, experience, expertise, record of publication and citation, media appearance, industry and academic recognition, and history of successful research in the field all indicate that Mr.\myname is \emph{\textbf{\ul{well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor}}}. These facts establish that it is beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and labor certification.
